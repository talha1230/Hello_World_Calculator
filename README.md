## Requirements

Ensure your development environment meets the following prerequisites for a successful Hello_World_Calculator project setup:

1. **Qt Creator or QMake Build System Installed:**¬†
   - Use Qt Creator for its integrated development environment (IDE) with internal build tools.
   - Alternatively, use QMake as the build system. Download the repo, open the **Qt Project file (.pro)**, and click on **Config Kit**.

2. **Qt SDK Installed:**
   - Download and install the Qt SDK from [qt.io](https://www.qt.io/download).
   - Opt for the more stable offline Open Source version instead of online installers.

3. **Compiler Configuration:**
   - Select a suitable MinGW compiler during the installation process, as the installer does not include a compiler by default.

4. **Installation of Qt Creator:**
   - It's highly recommended to install Qt Creator, serving as both an IDE and including internal build tools.

5. **CMake Consideration:**
   - The project does not use CMake; instead, QMake is bundled with Qt Creator and is the preferred build system.

By satisfying these requirements, you'll be well-equipped to embark on a smooth and efficient development journey with the Hello_World_Calculator project.

Feel free to reach out if you encounter any issues or need further assistance! üöÄ
