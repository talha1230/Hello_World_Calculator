## Requirements ‚úÖ

Ensure your development environment meets the following prerequisites for a successful Hello_World_Calculator project setup:

## How to Use üõ†Ô∏è

1. **Qt Creator or QMake Build System Installed:** 
   - Qt Creator is recommended for its integrated development environment (IDE) with internal build tools.
   - Alternatively, QMake build system can be used.
   - Download the repo; use Qt creator; just open the **Qt Project file (.pro)**, Then Click on **Config Kit**

2. **Qt SDK Installed:**
   - Download and install the Qt SDK from [qt.io](https://www.qt.io/download).
   - Opt for the more stable offline Open Source version instead of online installers.

3. **Compiler Configuration:**
   - Select a suitable MinGW compiler during the installation process as the installer does not include a compiler by default.

4. **Installation of Qt Creator:**
   - It's highly recommended to install Qt Creator, which serves as both an IDE and includes internal build tools.

5. **CMake Consideration:**
   - The project does not use CMake; instead, QMake is bundled with Qt Creator and is the preferred build system.

By satisfying these requirements, you'll be well-equipped to embark on a smooth and efficient development journey with the Hello_World_Calculator project.

Feel free to reach out if you encounter any issues or need further assistance! üöÄ
